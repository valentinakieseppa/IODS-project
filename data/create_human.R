#Exploring the dataset hd

summary (hd)

#Hd includes 8 variables and 195 observations (countries). The variables measure HD-index of different
#countries,their HDI-ranking and variables related to HDI, such as life expectancy, education 
#and gross national income.

#Gii inlcudes 10 variables and 195 observations (countries). It measures the gender inequality
#index for different countries, and inlcudes variables which measure different aspects related to
#this index and ranking between different countries.
